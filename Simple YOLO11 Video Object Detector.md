o Main Changes:

Video Processing: Changed from single image to frame-by-frame video processing  
File Output: Creates and returns a processed video file with annotations  
Comprehensive Comments: Added detailed explanations for every section  
Progress Tracking: Shows processing progress as it works through frames  
Automatic Download: Downloads the processed video when complete  

o How it Works:

Upload: User selects a video file (mp4, avi, mov, etc.)  
Processing: YOLO11 analyzes each frame and draws bounding boxes  
Output: Creates a new video with all detections highlighted  
Download: Automatically downloads the processed video  

o Key Features:  

Simple Structure: Easy to follow step-by-step process  
Progress Indicators: Shows percentage complete during processing  
Object Summary: Lists all detected object types at the end  
Error Handling: Graceful handling of invalid files  
Resource Management: Properly closes video files and frees memory  

o Usage:  
Just run the script in Google Colab, upload your video, and it will return a new video with all detected objects highlighted with bounding boxes and labels.  
The code maintains the same detection accuracy (15% confidence, 0.2 IoU threshold) but now works with video files of any length!
